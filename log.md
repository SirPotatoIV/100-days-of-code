# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Updated homepage so it was more clear to the user what they needed to do to interact with the web app. Added text to explain the controls when playing the game.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with some deployment issues with firebase. Unsure what the issue currently is because deployed site appears to be a commit or 2 behind. Creating a new component, updating text, etc went well. Good start to the coding challenge. May also update my portfolio today.

### Day 1: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed my very out of date portfolio. Found out there were several bugs in my links on previous commits.

**Thoughts:** I struggled just starting coding today. Without the direction of my now over bootcamp, it's hard to figure out where to focus my energy. It's hard to have direction with no new homework assignment or project to complete.

### Day 2: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to code while panicking about finding a job. Rough start to the 100 day challenge.

**Thoughts:** Apparently wasn't thinking "Oh, I need to code today."

**Link to work:** None completed :(

### Day 3: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cracked open an old project from my boot camp and started fixing some features that were never completed. Got the subscriber page to start adding new subscribers to the database.

**Thoughts:** It's always a little rough to jump back to a tech you haven't worked on in a while, but it was good to dust off the rust. I've been using Cloud FireStore lately, which doesn't really have a backend, so going back to a backend was definitely interesting.

### Day 4: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't really meet the criteria today. Help a local politician help update their Weedbly and applied for a full-time job.

**Thoughts:** Really need to start doing my minimum hour of coding in the morning before almost anything else. Leaving it until the end of the day is dangerous.

**Link to work:** There isn't any really.

### Day 5: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not a whole lot done. Started creating a new React App that will be my portfolio remade as a React App

**Thoughts:** Didn't get a whole lot done. Bounced around too much instead of just locking in my focus and hammering away at some code.

**Link to work:** There isn't any really.

### Day 4: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: https://github.com/SirPotatoIV/portfolio-react

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with getting started. Spent the day cleaning the house instead of coding. Tried to start at like 10:00 PM, but realized that is a horrible way to handle this. Definitely need to stick with the original lesson learned that I should be doing this first thing in the morning.

**Link to work:** There isn't any really.

### Day 4: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up Prettier in VS Code, started using yarn over npm, created a new react app to follow along with the Frontend Master's Course "Firebase with React".

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with getting started. This shouldn't be hard. I love to code. I think I'm just overwhelmed with what to work on. Apply for jobs? Contact people to work for? Watch a tutorial?

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
